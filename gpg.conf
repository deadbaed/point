# Group names may be defined like this:
#   group mynames = paige 0x12345678 joe patti
#
# Any time "mynames" is a recipient (-r or --recipient), it will be
# expanded to the names "paige", "joe", and "patti", and the key ID
# "0x12345678".  Note there is only one level of expansion - you
# cannot make an group that points to another group.  Note also that
# if there are spaces in the recipient name, this will appear as two
# recipients.  In these cases it is better to use the key ID.

#group mynames = paige 0x12345678 joe patti


# GnuPG can automatically locate and retrieve keys as needed using
# this option.  This happens when encrypting to an email address (in
# the "user@@example.com" form) and there are no keys matching
# "user@example.com" in the local keyring.  This option takes any
# number mechanisms which are tried in the given order.  The default
# is "--auto-key-locate local" to search for keys only in the local
# key database.  Uncomment the next line to locate a missing key using
# two DNS based mechanisms.

# Because some mailers change lines starting with "From " to ">From "
# it is good to handle such lines in a special way when creating
# cleartext signatures; all other PGP versions do it this way too.
# To enable full OpenPGP compliance you may want to use this option.

#no-escape-from-lines
