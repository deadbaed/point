# point
pardon my french, my dot files.

## install
run `./install.sh` in the root folder followed by what you want to configure.

currently the script works with **`git vim gpg zsh i3`**.

## vscode
to sync settings in vscode, hit `ctrl + p` and run `ext install Shan.code-settings-sync`, and restart vscode.

once vscode has restarted, hit `shift + alt + d` and enter your [git token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) (vscode will open a new page for you if you dont have one alreay saved) and enter your [gist id](https://gist.github.com/x4m3/09c508d05a4eb733a85598788226e407) (for me it's **`09c508d05a4eb733a85598788226e407`**) afterwards.

your settings should start to download, and you should get in the output tab a log of the extension.
